%% nynorsk.apc - Norwegian Nynorsk version of apacite elements.
%% Version 1.0.
%% Written by Karl Ove Hufthammer <karl@huftis.org>.
%%
%% Note: To be in line with Norwegian rules of punctuation
%%       a comma is never used before '&' or 'and', and there
%%       is no space between initials. The macro for these
%%       modifications can be found at the end of this file.
%%       Remove them to use a more 'APA-like' style.
%%
%% There are no official Norwegian translations of APA.
%% Some ideas for this translation have been taken from the following sources:
