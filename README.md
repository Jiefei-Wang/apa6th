One or two modifications to
[apa.cls](http://www.ilsp.gr/homepages/protopapas/apacls.html) and
apacite.bst (which are based on APA 5th) to make them look more like
APA 6th.

Very incomplete.

Changes so far:
* **Bold font** on the headings used in ThreeLevelHeading (leveltwo,
  levelfour, levelfive)
* Output DOI in references (copied from
  [jovcite.bst](http://www.tobias-elze.de/latex/jovcite.bst))

TODO:
* APA 6th merged all those headings alternatives into one, so really
  the default should be FiveLevelHeading and the other alternatives
  should be removed.
